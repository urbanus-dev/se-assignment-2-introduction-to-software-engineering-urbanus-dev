>>Traditional Programming Writing code according to specs and debugging it to make sure it works are standard programming tasks.
>>Software engineering involves steps like planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance and is methodical and process-oriented. It employs software development lifecycle management techniques such as Waterfall, Scrum, and Agile


#Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands. The SDLC defines and outlines a detailed plan with stages, or phases, that each encompass their own process and deliverables. Adherence to the SDLC enhances development speed and minimizes project risks and costs associated with alternative methods of production.
**Importance of SDLC:**
>It provides a standardized framework that defines activities and deliverables
>It aids in project planning, estimating, and scheduling
>It makes project tracking and control easier
>It increases visibility on all aspects of the life cycle to all stakeholders involved in the development process
>It increases the speed of development
>It improves client relations
>It decreases project risks
>It decreases project management expenses and the overall cost of production

#Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

**Planning:**
Involves defining the project scope, objectives, and resources. It's essential for determining feasibility and creating a roadmap for the project

**Requirements Analysis:**
Gathering and analyzing the requirements from stakeholders to ensure the software meets their needs. This phase results in a detailed requirement specification document

**Design:**
Translating requirements into a detailed design plan, including architectural and detailed design. This phase includes creating prototypes and user interface designs 

**Implementation (Coding):**
Actual coding of the software based on the design documents. This phase involves dividing the work into units or modules and building the software 

**Testing:**
Testing the software for defects and ensuring that it meets the specified requirements. This phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing 

**Deployment:**
Releasing the software to the production environment for use by end-users. This phase may include beta testing and final adjustments before the official release 

**Maintenance:**
Ongoing support and maintenance of the software to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. This phase ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time


#Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
**Agile methodology** is a project management approach that prioritizes cross-functional collaboration and continuous improvement. It divides projects into smaller phases and guides teams through cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation.
>>Approach: Iterative and incremental.
>>Flexibility: High, adaptable to changes throughout the project.
>>Documentation: Minimal, focuses on working software and collaboration.
>>Team Structure: Cross-functional, self-organizing teams.
>>Customer Involvement: Continuous feedback and regular updates.
>>Project Phases: Multiple phases can run in parallel.


**Waterfall methodology** is a linear form of project management ideal for projects where the end result is clearly established from the beginning of the project. The expectations for the project and the deliverables of each stage are clear and are required in order to progress to the next phase.Waterfall is a linear project progression, so itâ€™s best suited for projects with a defined end goal. If a project owner has a clear and specific vision of an app, for example, and is confident it will not change throughout the project development, Waterfall methodologies could be a good system to follow.
>>Approach: Linear and sequential.
>>Flexibility: Low, changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed.
>>Documentation: Extensive, detailed planning and design before implementation.
>>Team Structure: Structured roles with clear responsibilities.
>>Customer Involvement: Limited to the beginning and end of the project.
>>Project Phases: Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
